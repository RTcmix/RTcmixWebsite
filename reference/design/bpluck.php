<h3>bpluck</h3>
<i>some wort of weird Karplus-Strong variant</i>

Jeez, I have no real clue what this code does.  It looks like it's missing
a setup function, and no, it doesn't do a block-computing version of
<a href="pluck.php">pluck</a>.  It probably dates back to the mid-1980's
(or earlier).
<p>
From the source code:
<hr>
float bpluck(float xin, float *q)

<?php include($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/includes/foot.inc'); ?>
