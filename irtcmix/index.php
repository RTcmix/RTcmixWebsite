<h1>iRTcmix</h1>

iRTcmix enables iOS developers to easily incorporate interactive sound into their iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch apps. The library includes the compiled RTcmix object and Objective-C classes for communicating with the RTcmix audio engine and for interacting with Minc scores. iRTcmix greatly simplifies the process of adding audio to iOS apps; start making noise with just a few lines of code! The library and demo projects are available at GitHub:

<b>iLooch</b><br />
by Brad Garton
<p>
iLooch is an iPhone/iPod-touch application designed to generate evolving ambient sounds. The music is not "sampled"; it is instead created by generative and algorithmic rule-sets coupled with various synthesis techniques. They'll go on forever and ever! (well, at least for a few hours...) Because the music is being constructed on-the-fly, each time it plays it will be slightly different. Such is life.

<b>iMonkeypants</b><br />
by Ryan Carter
<p>
iMonkeypants is an album of algorithmically generated, listener-interactive electronica in the form of an iPhone app. The music responds in real time to the position of the device, giving the listener control over certain aspects of the sound while it plays.
